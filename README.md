# ISD: Island Sampling Day Project
## Island sampling day, chapter one: Crete, a microbiome study to explore environmental drivers of community composition across ecosystems in the island of Crete, Greece
A snapshot of the prokaryotic diversity across the island of Crete. Aim to:
a. describe the first full island microbial community assessment 
b. shed light on phylotypes found not to be all the same across Crete’s distinct terrestrial habitats (intra comparison)
c. present facilitate a “local” (island) vs “global” exploration via Island vs (e.g. EMP) World soil phylotype (e.g EMP) comparative analysis (e.g EMP) (inter comparison)
This repository holds all ISD ecological analysis scripts
