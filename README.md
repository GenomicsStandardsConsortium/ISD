# ISD: Island Sampling Day Project
## Island sampling day, chapter one: Crete, a microbiome study to explore environmental drivers of community composition across ecosystems in the island of Crete, Greece
A snapshot of the prokaryotic diversity across the island of Crete. Aim to:
<ol type="a">
  <li>describe the first full island microbial community assessment</li>
  <li>shed light on phylotypes found not to be all the same across Crete’s distinct terrestrial habitats (<i>intra comparison</i>)</li>
  <li>present a “local” (island) vs “global” (world, e.g. EMP) soil phylotype comparative analysis (<i>inter comparison</i>)</li>
</ol>
This repository holds ISD molecular ecology analysis pertinent scripts.
ISD sequence data are available as a <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB21776" target="blank">European Nucleotide Archive repository project</a>.
